Using JSON-e: contexts and templates

I've started my work at Mozilla in this **Outreachy** round making contributions in [JSON-e](https://github.com/taskcluster/json-e). That I've told (very quickly) in my first post, now I will talk with more details about how the project works and focus on its use. 

Using and seeing **JSON-e** applications I really believe that it was proposed to solve a problem of parsing data structures into more easily editable and tratable data structures in a  specific context. **JSON-e** is present as a solution to manipulate JSON and YAML files (more used formats to translate/manipulate objects in programs) and include any kind of necessary parametrization configuration. It is easy to use for people with familiarity with languages such as Python and Javascript, but there is a Golang client as well :)

You first need download the lib, and thenâ€¦ import it into your program o/

Some practical examples in JS language (this was the official language of my intership, most of the problems and bug were solved with this language) :

```
import jsone from 'json-e'; => import the lib

var template = {a: {$eval: "foo.bar"}}; => your template.
var context = {foo: {bar: "zoo"}}; => context that you want parametrize. 
console.log(jsone(template, context)); => magic method that performs the parametrization from your context to a specific template.
// -> { a: 'zoo' } => waited result.:)
```

for more complex operations, there are operators like: *json, if, then, else, let, merge, sort, etc* . An important point is the character *$*, which marks the beginning of a **JSON-e** command. 

Other **JSON-e** examples: 

```
*if, then, else* 

import jsone from 'json-e';

var template = {key: {$if: 'cond', then: 1}, k2: 3};
var context = {cond: true};
console.log(jsone(template, context));   
// ->{key: 1, k2: 3}
```

```
*let*

import json from 'json-e';

var template = {$let: {ts: 100, foo: 200},
           in: [{$eval: "ts+foo"}, {$eval: "ts-foo"}, {$eval: "ts*foo"}]};
var context =  {};
console.log(jsone(template, context));   
// -> [300, -100, 20000]
```

```
*merge*

import json from 'json-e';

var template = {$merge: [{a: 1, b: 1}, {b: 2, c: 3}, {d: 4}]}
var context = {}
console.log(jsone(template, context));
// -> {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4}
```
